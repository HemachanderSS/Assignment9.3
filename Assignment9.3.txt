1.What is meant by FlumeNG ?
*Apache Flume is a distributed,reliable,available service for efficiently collecting,
aggregating,and moving large amounts of streaming data into the Hadoop Distributed
File System.
*It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows 
and is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms for failover and 
recovery.
*YARN coordinates data ingest from Apache Flume and other services that deliver raw data 
into an Enterprise Hadoop cluster.
*To solve certain known issues and limitations,Flume requires a refactoring of some core 
classes and systems. 
*This bug is a parent issue to track the development of a "Flume NG" - necessary 
refactoring. Subtasks should be added to track individual systems and components.

2.Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?
*Yes it provide end to end reliability of the flow.by default flume uses a transactional 
approach in the data flow.
*Sources and sinks encapsulated in a transactional repository provides by the channels.
*This channels responsible to pass reliably from end to end in the flow.
*It provides 100% reliability to data flow.

3.Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations?
*Yes it support multiplexing flow. The event flows from one sources to multiple channels
and multiple destinations.
*It is acheived by defining a flow multiplexer.

4.Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is
faster?
There are 2 channel types in Flume are:
*Memory Channel:
	Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.
*File Channel:
	File Channel writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading 
the event from a source.The file is deleted only after the contents are successfully 
delivered to the sink.

Memory channel is the fastest channel among the three however has the risk of data loss. 
The channel that you choose completely depends on the nature of the big data application 
and the value of each event.
